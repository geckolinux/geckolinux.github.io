{"name":"GeckoLinux","tagline":"Linux for Detail Oriented Geckos","body":"### Welcome to GeckoLinux\r\nGeckoLinux is a Linux spin based on the openSUSE distribution, with a focus on polish and out-of-the-box usability on the desktop.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation Behind GeckoLinux\r\nWe all know that there's a profusion of Linux distributions and spins out there. So why create another one?\r\n\r\n1. Linux spins based on openSUSE are rarely created and seldom discovered.\r\n1. openSUSE is a fundamentally excellent Linux distribution, but it suffers from a suboptimal default configuration for desktop usage.\r\n1. The [Suse Studio](http://susestudio.com) makes it relatively easy to create custom spins of openSUSE.\r\n\r\n#### GeckoLinux Features\r\n- The latest stable release of the Cinnamon desktop environment with a pleasant default configuration.\r\n- Carefully selected open source desktop programs and proprietary media codecs pre-installed and ready to use.\r\n- Beautiful open source font rendering configured out of the box.\r\n- Much more open source and patent encumbered software available in the pre-configured repositories.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
