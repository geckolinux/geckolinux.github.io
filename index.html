<h3><a id="welcome-to-geckolinux" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-geckolinux" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GeckoLinux</h3>

<p>GeckoLinux is a Linux spin based on the openSUSE distribution, with a focus on polish and out-of-the-box usability on the desktop.</p>

<h4><a id="geckolinux-features" class="anchor" href="#geckolinux-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GeckoLinux Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>An installable live DVD image based on openSUSE Leap 42.1 under 1GB in size</li>
<li>The latest stable release of the Cinnamon desktop environment with a pleasant default configuration</li>
<li>Carefully selected open source desktop programs and proprietary media codecs pre-installed and ready to use</li>
<li>Beautiful open source font rendering configured out of the box</li>
<li>Much more open source and patent encumbered software available in the pre-configured repositories</li>
</ul>


<h4><a id="how-different" class="anchor" href="#how-different" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Is This Different From openSUSE?</h4>

<ul>
<li>GeckoLinux comes as an installable live DVD image, whereas openSUSE Leap needs to be installed before using.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux offers common niceties such as proprietary media codecs, whereas openSUSE requires users to know how to add additional repositories and which ones to add.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux prefers packages from the Packman repo when they are available, whereas some of openSUSE's default packages don't work with patent-restricted features even if the features are installed from other sources.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux comes pre-configured with what many would consider to be good font rendering, whereas many users find openSUSE's default font configuration to be less than desirable.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux does not force the installation of additional recommended packages after system installation, whereas openSUSE pre-installs patterns and automatically installs recommended package dependencies, thus causing many additional and possibly unwanted packages to be installed the first time the package manager is used.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux's desktop programs can be uninstalled with all their dependencies, whereas openSUSE's patterns often cause uninstalled packages to be automatically re-installed.</li>
<li>GeckoLinux features a PolicyKit configuration that is more relaxed than openSUSE's, allowing common actions such as mounting/unmounting disks, connecting/disconnecting WiFI networks, and rebooting to be be performed without entering the root password.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation Behind GeckoLinux</h4>

<p>We all know that there's a profusion of Linux distributions and spins out there. So why create another one?</p>

<ul>
<li>Spins based on openSUSE are rarely published and seldom discovered.</li>
<li>openSUSE is a fundamentally excellent Linux distribution, but it suffers from a suboptimal default configuration for desktop usage.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://susestudio.com">Suse Studio</a> makes it relatively easy to create custom spins of openSUSE.</li>
<li>There is currently no official installable live media for openSUSE Leap 42.1.</li>
<li>The Cinnamon desktop environment is not available as an official installation option in openSUSE.</li>
</ul>



<h3><a id="who" class="anchor" href="#who" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Are You?</h3>

<p>I've used Linux on the desktop since approximately 2001. I have used many versions of openSUSE since the project's inception, and I used SuSE Linux before that. I've always appreciated openSUSE's flexibility and highly innovative infrastructure, but the profusion of "paper cuts" in the default configuration always made me think twice before recommending it to others. This projects sets out to change that.</p>
